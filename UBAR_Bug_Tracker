# UBAR Bug Tracker

This project contains bug documentation for the UBAR system.

## Contents

- `UBAR_Bug_Tracker.xlsx`: An Excel sheet with daily bug entries, test results, and retesting updates.

## Usage

I update this Excel sheet daily to track new bugs, fixed bugs, and retesting status. This helps in organizing QA work and communicating with the development team.
